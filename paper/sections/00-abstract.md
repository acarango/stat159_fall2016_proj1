#Abstract

This report is intended to give an overview of the set of computational tools I used to create it, including Markdown, Git, Github, Pandoc and makefile. The ultimate goal is to expose you to the general process of creating a reproducible data science report, help you understand how it is done, and perhaps help you avoid the difficulties I encountered. In this report, I will:

* give an overview of each computational tool I used, including its background, function, and basic usage.
* discuss how I used these tools in this specific project.
* explore in what ways I found these tools easy or hard to use.
* describe my experience making this report i.e. how long it took, whether I got help and whom I got it from, what parts were most difficult/easy

#Abstract

This report is intended to give a general overview of bash, Markdown, Git, Github, Pandoc, GNU Make. The ultimate goal is to expose you to the general process of creating a reproducible project and perhaps help you avoid the difficulties I encountered. In this report, I will:

* give an overview of each computational tool I used, including its function and basic usage.
* discuss how I used these tools in this specific project.
* explore in what ways I found these tools easy or hard to use.
* describe my experience making this report i.e. how long it took, what I fond eary or hard about it, and what resources I used to help me along the way.

#Abstract

This report is intended to give an overview of Markdown, MacDown, Git, Github, Pandoc, GNU Make, and GNU nano. The ultimate goal is to expose you to the general process and intricacies of creating a reproducible data science report and perhaps help you avoid the difficulties I encountered. In this report, I will:

* give an overview of each computational tool I used, including its background, function, and basic usage.
* discuss how I used these tools in this specific project.
* explore in what ways I found these tools easy or hard to use.
* describe my experience making this report i.e. how long it took, whether I got help and whom I got it from, what parts were most difficult/easy

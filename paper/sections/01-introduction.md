#Introduction

Hello there! This project's purpose is to teach you about itself. Let me explain; I used a set of computational tools (including bash, Markdown, MacDown, Pandoc, Git, Github, GNU Make, and GNU nano) to create this project. I will give an overview of each of these tools, explain how I used them to create this project. I will also detail the process from my perspective, describing parts I found easy/frustrating/quick/slow/etc.

This can be used as reference material for those who are already somewhat experienced in making reproducible projects. However, it can also serve as a tutorial for the less experienced. This project is quite simple, and its file structure is basic, so it can also be seen as a template to expand upon and alter in order to get a more complex project with completely different content.

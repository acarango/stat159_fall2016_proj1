#Introduction

Hello there! This project's purpose is to help teach about some basic computational tools by explaining how I made this project itself. The tools in question include bash, Markdown, Git, Github, GNU Make, and Pandoc. I will give an overview of each of these tools, explain how I used them to create this project, and detail my experience, describing parts of the process I found easy/frustrating/quick/slow/etc.

This can be used as reference material for those who are already somewhat experienced in making reproducible projects. However, it can also serve as a tutorial for the less experienced. This project is quite simple, and its file structure is basic, so it can also be seen as a template to expand upon and alter in order to create more complex projects. Enjoy!

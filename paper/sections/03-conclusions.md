#Conclusions

All in all, this project took me about 12 hours to complete over the course of 4 days. About half this time was spent writing and the other half setting up the file structure, creating the makefile, and formatting. Little help was required trhoughout this process. I consulted the class GSI once for help regarding Git, but other than that I worked completely independently. The hardest parts of this project included coding the makefile correctly and learning how to use Git and GitHub smoothly. The eastiest parts included using Pandoc and writing in Markown. In conclusion here are the most important lessons I learned working on this project.

* It is important to have a file structure in place, have Git initialized, and be connected to GitHub before getting into the "meat" of the project.
* Commiting to Git often is very helpful and (although I did not encounter this situation) prevents loss of content that sometimes happens without automated version control.
* Using a text editor such as MacDown, which has a good looking interface, prevents mistakes in Markdown and it is easy to copy into nano to make edits.
* Pandoc can convert to essentially any document format, so you can always start with a simple markdown file without worrying about what format the final product will be in.
* Make sure to have bash commands memorized well in order to avoid having to waste time looking up commands.
* Automating the creation of the creation of the final document via Make is worth doing. In more complex projects where people may want to verify conclusions or substitute data it is important to make workflow easily reproducible, and Make does this exactly.
